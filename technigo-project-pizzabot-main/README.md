# Pizzabot

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

    In this assignment I'm supposed to code a simple pizza bot to practice conditionals.

    Since this program is fairly simple I could hold the logic in my head instead of making a flowchart, so I started from the top of the program and worked my way downwards.
    I added another .js file to practise switch statements aswell.

    I feel content with the amount of time i put into this exercise.
