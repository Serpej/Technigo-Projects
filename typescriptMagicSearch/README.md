This project is an exercise in using API:s to fetch and display data, while using concepts like Enums, Interfaces, Classes and Decorations.

1. I started off with makeing the HTML boilerplate, creating a form for the search bar and connecting the css and js.
2. Setting upp interfaces for the APIfetch, the response.data and the structure to 
separate concerns.
