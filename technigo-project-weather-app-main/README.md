# Weather app

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

- In this assignemnt I have fetched data from a Open Weather API to create a weather app with a fixed design.
- How I approached the task:
  1. Got API key
  2. Made a few containers in the idex.html
  3. Fetched data
  4. Appended data in containers
  5. Styled each container and created pseudo elements where needed
  6. Created a switch between night and day mode depending on the hour
  7. Make the webpage responsive to width.
- If I had more time, I would make the day and night mode respond to minutes. I would also work more on how to clamp() the fontsoze to make them scale smoother with the size of the screen. And honestly probably find some nicer Weather
