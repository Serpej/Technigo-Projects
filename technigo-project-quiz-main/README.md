# Quiz

This is a Buzz Quiz to tell what Magic The Gathering color you are! It's a simple design where you have 6 questions per component, one for each color and one for colorless. In the end It displays the resulting data and gives some information about what the color combination stands for.

1. Sketched what the question components and final result should look like.
2. Made a data.Json file for my questions and a basic mapping of the data to make the components work.
3. Thirdly I figured out how to use the root array in data to make one question show at the time.
4. Made useState hooks for the color counting and remembering each choice
  for when they click on the previous button.
5. Make the guild data.
