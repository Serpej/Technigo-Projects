This is a Task manager project where you can add, complete and and filter tasks.

I wanted to practice typescript with enums and interfaces.

First I made some basic HTML and CSS so I could add the Typescript I wanted.
Then I had to learn how to use enums and interfaces using Copilot and a template from Technigo as my main source of knowledge.
Lastly I had some trouble with the filtering states and methods. But I was able to fix it.

If I had more time I would want to make the website look better, spending more time on the CSS
and maybe learning more about decorations aswell

Here''s the current state of the project. Enjoy!
