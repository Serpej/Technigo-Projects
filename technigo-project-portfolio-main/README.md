# Portfolio

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

1. This is a portfolio with th different projects I've made in this technigo course.

2. I started top-down by making the Project component and filled in what I needed. After that I made each subcomponent
  and made sure each got the right props.

3. If I had more time, i would probably make this page look nicer with more css, also adding additional webpages.

4. to run the program locally, install all dependencies with npm i and then npm run dev.
