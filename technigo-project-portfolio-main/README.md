# Portfolio

This is a portfolio with th different projects I've made in this technigo course.

1. I started top-down by making the Project component and filled in what I needed. After that I made each subcomponent and made sure each got the right props.

2. When the setup was done, I took inspiration from a design I found and made my own take on it, finding a new color palette I enjoyed.

3. I then made the webside responsive to different screen sizes, and smoothed out the different threshold switches.

4. Added my contact information and a profile picture down at the bottom.

5. Lastly add a netlify.toml file and deploy it there.

If I had more time, i would probably make this page look nicer with more css, also adding additional webpages.
