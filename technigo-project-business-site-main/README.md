# Business Site

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

- In this assignment I created a business webpage with a video or image header, a sign up form and a responsive design.

- How you approached the task, what tools and techniques you used, and how you planned it:

- I started with making a stech of the webpage to get a feel for what I wanted it to look like. Then I made the infrasctructure, chose a cool video and aligned all the items correctly.


- If you had more time, what would be next?
