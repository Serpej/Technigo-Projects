# Business Site

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

- In this assignment I created a business webpage with a video or image header, a sign up form and a responsive design.

- I started with making a sketch of the webpage to get a feel for what I wanted it to look like. Then I made the infrasctructure, chose a cool video and aligned all the items correctly.

- This time I chose to make the desktop version first, and then convert it to a mobile version. The reason was that I wanted a vertical video banner, that wouldnt fit in a mobile version.

- After getting the main parts done, I arranged the color palette using colors form the video itself, and made some color changes depending on if your on desktop or not. 

- If I had more time I would make a banner video in the mobile version aswell. Right now it's a bit empty.
