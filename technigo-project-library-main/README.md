# Library

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

- In this assignment I built a digital library, using an array of data. To the data I added some filters.
- How you approached the task, what tools and techniques you used, and how you planned it
- If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
