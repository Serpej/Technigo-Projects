# Library

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

- In this assignment I built a digital library, using an array of data. To the data I added some filters. I worked in the following order:
  1. Sktech up a rough design by hand.
  2. get my containers in order.
  3. Choose my styling.
  4. started making the JS needed, like objects and hover effects for the cards.
  5. Create the js needed for the search options.

- If I had more time, I would make a switch toggle button so that you coule see all text cards as visiual pictures.
