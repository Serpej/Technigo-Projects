# News Site

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

- In this assignment I'm charged with making a simple new website with a big article and some smaller ones using flexbox and grid.
- First i sketched out an idea on paper to what I wanted my website to look like, and then I created all the boxes. That way it was easier to understand what needed flexbox and what needed flex grid. I approached this project with Mobile first and worked my way up to Desktop, which I found pragmatic.  
- If I had more time, I would definitly give thanks to the rest of the creators of all the images I took, but since the figure tag gave me a headache I skipped the ones inside the articles.
